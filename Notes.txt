Que-> what is firebase ?
Ans-> 
    Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform by Google that helps developers build web and mobile apps quickly without managing servers.

    ðŸ”¹ Key Features:

    Authentication â€“ user login/signup with email, Google, etc.

    Firestore / Realtime Database â€“ store and sync app data in real time.

    Cloud Storage â€“ store images, videos, and files.

    Hosting â€“ fast and secure web hosting for your apps.

    Cloud Functions â€“ run backend code without managing a server.

    Push Notifications â€“ send messages to users via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).

    ðŸ‘‰ In short: Firebase provides ready-to-use backend services so you can focus more on the frontend and app logic, not on managing servers or databases.
